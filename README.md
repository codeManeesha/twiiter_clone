# TWITTER-CLONE
 This is a simple Twitter clone project created by Samruddhi Kshirsagar, Maneesha Kumari, and Krishna Gaikwad. The project aims to provide basic functionality similar to Twitter, allowing users to create accounts, log in, add tweets to their feed, and view tweets from other users.

 ## Features

 1. User Registration: Users can sign up for a new account by providing their name, email, and password. The registration form includes validation using regex to ensure that the email address provided is in the correct format.

2. User Login: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their email and password.

3. Tweet Feed: Once logged in, users can view a feed of tweets from other users. They can see the tweet content, the username of the user who posted it, and the timestamp of the tweet.

4. Add Tweet: Users can create and post their own tweets, which will appear in their followers' feeds.

5. Follow/Unfollow Users: Users can choose to follow or unfollow other users. By following a user, their tweets will appear in the user's feed.
